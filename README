This branch contains our implementation of KNN where we did some basic feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning. The values we hyperparameter tuned were:
 - PCA number of compnents
 - KNN number of neighbors

One thing we tried that didn't yeild good results was building a separate model for Cats and Dogs.
