This branch contains the random forest model that we implemented which in the end was able to achieve a 47.61% accuracy. Included are some of the different version files of our hyperparameter tuning and model files where we tried some of the following things:
 - tuning number of estimators
 - tuning min samples per leaf
 - tuning max features to consider at each step
 - different feature engineering
 - different scoring/accuracy functions
other things that were tried that did not work well:
 - tuning minimum entropy increase which consistently found 0.0 to be the best value
